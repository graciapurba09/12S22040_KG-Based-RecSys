This project focuses on building a Knowledge Graph-Based Recommender System to enhance user-item interaction predictions. The system utilizes structured knowledge to improve recommendation accuracy, overcoming limitations of traditional approaches.

# Introduction
A recommender system is a type of information filtering system that seeks to predict and show the preferences of a user, offering tailored suggestions for items such as books, movies, or music based on their browsing and selection history. These systems utilize algorithms and data analysis to provide personalized recommendations, enhancing user experience and engagement.

Knowledge Graph (KG)-based recommender system technology uses knowledge graphs as auxiliary information to improve the accuracy and explain-ability of the result of recommendations. Knowledge graphs, which are heterogeneous graphs with nodes representing entities and edges representing relationships, help to illustrate the relationships between items and their attributes, and integrate user and user-side information, capturing the relationships between users and items, as well as user preferences, more accurately.
